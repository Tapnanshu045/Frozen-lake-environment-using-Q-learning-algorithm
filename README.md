# Frozen-lake-environment-using-Q-learning-algorithm
This project implements a Q-learning agent to solve the FrozenLake environment by learning optimal policies through exploration and reward feedback. It visualizes performance trends, ε-decay, and success rate, demonstrating how reinforcement learning improves decision-making over episodes.
